This is the modifications I did to the MKS DLC, I have done so far. The custom firmware is coming soon! 
Here are the instructions for the changes: 
To configure the MKS DLC32 or DLC32 MAX as a CNC (not a laser), flash GRBL-ESP32 for DLC32, connect via USB or the TFT console at 115200 baud, and paste the following commands line by line, waiting for ok after each one: 
$RST=$ (optional one-time reset), $0=10, $1=255, $2=0, $3=0, $4=0, $5=0, $6=0, $10=1, $11=0.010, $12=0.002, $13=0, $20=1, $21=0, $22=1, $23=0, $24=50, $25=1000, $26=250, $27=2.0, $30=1000, $31=0, $32=0, $110=2000, $111=2000, $112=800, $120=100, $121=100, $122=60, $100=80.000, $101=80.000, $102=400.000, $130=300, $131=200, $132=80; after pasting everything, power-cycle the board, run $$ to confirm the settings were saved, and if any axis moves in the wrong direction adjust $3 using bit values (X=1, Y=2, Z=4). For automatic tool length probing, connect the spindle or tool to the PROBE pin and the PCB or probe plate to GND, then run G21 G90 G38.2 Z-10 F50 G92 Z1.6 G0 Z5 (replace 1.6 with your probe plate thickness). Make sure laser mode is disabled ($32=0), motors remain energized for milling ($1=255), and soft limits and homing are enabled; on the DLC32 TFT always select GRBL mode and avoid relying on sliders, as all persistent configuration should be done through $ commands in the console.

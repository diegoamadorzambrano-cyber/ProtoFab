# ProtoFab  
A machine built for tinkerers and engineers who want more control.  

# Bringing PCB Manufacturing to Your Desk  
This whole thing started because making PCBs at home just felt harder than it needed to be. Sending boards out for fabrication kills momentum. Waiting days for a simple prototype? Not my type of workflow. It ruins the fun. And let’s be honest, most desktop CNCs are either too noisy, too messy, or clearly made for woodworkers, not electronics enthusiasts. I wanted something that made PCB prototyping feel as instant as opening a CAD file. Something you actually want sitting on your desk, not hiding out in the garage. Instead of just buying a closed-off CNC and twisting my process around it, I built a machine that works with me. Every change in this project happened because I ran into an issue and then redesigned to fix it. So, ProtoFab isn’t just a finished machine, its a living platform that keeps getting better.  

## Project Goals
* Make PCB milling a true desktop activity.
* Keep noise, dust, and size friendly for any room.
* Focus on rigidity and accuracy, not just movement.
* Stay modular so tools and features can keep evolving.
* Software that promotes actual modularity.
* Iterate endlessly.

## Why Build Instead of Buy?
Buying a CNC is definitely faster. But you’re stuck with someone else’s decisions. Most bought machines have fixed frames, barely any ways to upgrade them, and workflows that are just hard to use in a day to day scenario. You end up paying for stuff you don’t care about and missing the pieces you actually need.

With ProtoFab, I traded convenience for control. Every joint, every rail, and every bit of software exists because it just didnt meet expectations. My goal isn’t to beat commercial machines on convenience but on personalisation and modularity.

## Software  
The software is runned by a MKS DLC32 MAX, running GRBL. Instead of just running on a generic interface, I’m tweaking the firmware to fit real CNC workflows. That means removing pointless 3D printer features and adding tools for probing, leveling, and tool changes the way this machine actually needs. Software has to meet the same criteria as as my hardware simple, clear, and easy to adapt.

## How everything ties togueter.
I ensured everything worked togueter, like clockwork, the frame should be stiff to reduce innacuracies, the code should be easy to use, the hardware should be clean and easy to handle, and the design should be clean and eye pleasing. I believe that is the essence of what I have to work with, with this CNCs no longer have to be this extremely expensive, closed minded, machin.

## What This Project Is Really About  
Honestly, ProtoFab isn’t just about building a CNC. It’s about learning how to trully do a quality project, and getting comfortable with constant iteration. Every version exists because the last one taught me something I couldn’t ignore.

The goal? Make PCB manufacturing feel like a natural part of your workspace—so that the machine evolves along with your ideas.
